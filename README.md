# Jumia-Product-Performance-Dashboard
The objective of this project is to design and build an interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes the performance of products listed on Jumia. I explored how pricing, discounts, reviews and ratings influence product performance and customer engagement. The final dashboard supports data-driven decision-making in an e-commerce context.
